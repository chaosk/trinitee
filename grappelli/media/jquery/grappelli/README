Build instructions
==================

$: cd media/jquery/grappelli/
$: python build.py -m

That is all.

It will generate those files:

 - dist/jquery.grappelli.js
 - dist/jquery.grappelli.min.js


Production vs development
=========================

Edit the file templates/admin/base.html to toggle between minified/merged and 
source files.
