The primary author of django-admin-tools is David Jean Louis <izimobil@gmail.com>.

I'd like to thanks the following people in no particular order:
- creators of the mockup of the initial django-cms dashboard proposal;
- all the people that gave me feedback on the django-cms mailing list;
- ojii and its django-dashboard draft from which I borrowed some concepts;
- James Bennett and its excellent django-registration pluggable app from 
  which I borrowed many things, especially from the documentation.
